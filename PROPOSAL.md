# ai-browser (`aib`) — Proposal: An LLM-First Browser-Testing Engine

**Status:** Proposal — approved for Phase 0 spike
**Date:** 2026-07-10
**Author:** Leon (with Claude)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Playwright and Puppeteer are excellent general-purpose automation tools, but they are a poor fit for LLM-agent-driven user testing for two structural reasons:

1. **Resource heaviness.** A Node.js driver process (~150–250 MB RSS), ~1 GB of downloaded browser binaries, and — under parallelism — a full browser instance per worker. The abstraction layers add protocol chatter and latency. An LLM agent running dozens of short exploratory sessions per hour pays this cost over and over.
2. **Input that doesn't mimic a user.** The mouse teleports to the target and clicks instantly. There are no movement curves, no approach timing, no overshoot, no typing rhythm. Pages that depend on hover paths, pointer telemetry, drag physics, or human-scale timing behave differently under Playwright than under a real user — which is exactly the gap "user testing" is supposed to close. Third-party widgets (OAuth screens, payment iframes) sometimes break outright under synthetic-instant input.

Secondary problems for LLM consumers specifically:

- **Page representation is an afterthought.** Agents get raw HTML dumps, screenshots, or bolted-on accessibility snapshots. Token cost per observation is high; there is no "what changed since my last action" primitive, so agents re-read whole pages.
- **Failure reporting is human-oriented.** A raw `TimeoutError` forces the agent to guess. Agents need structured causes ("click blocked: element occluded by [e3] cookie banner") they can self-correct from in one turn.
- **MCP is a wrapper, not a design center.** playwright-mcp wraps the existing engine; the engine's session model, waiting model, and output formats were never designed for a token-budgeted consumer.

**Goal:** a purpose-built engine that fixes the resource and realism problems, keeps Playwright-class deterministic testing via code injection, and treats LLM agents as the first-class consumer via native MCP.

### Goals

- Minimal-footprint driver: single static binary, no runtime, no browser downloads (drive the *installed* Chrome/Edge).
- Human-realistic input: movement curves, timing, typing cadence — reproducible via seeds.
- True OS-level input mode for maximum fidelity on third-party flows.
- Token-efficient, diff-based page observation for agents.
- Deterministic testing: init-script injection, network mock/record-replay, virtual clock, traces, a scripted test runner.
- Native MCP server (stdio + streamable HTTP).
- Agent exploration → exported deterministic regression test, as a first-class workflow.

### Non-Goals (v1)

- Firefox/Safari support (protocol layer is designed for WebDriver BiDi later; see §10).
- Cloud grid / distributed execution.
- Defeating bot-detection systems. Human-motion realism exists for *testing fidelity* (analytics, event handlers, UX timing, fragile third-party widgets on flows you are authorized to test) — not for evading anti-abuse systems.
- A general web-scraping framework.

## 2. Architecture Overview

**`aib`: one static Rust binary** with subcommands `daemon | mcp | run | trace | doctor`.

```
┌─────────────┐  stdio MCP   ┌──────────────────────────────┐   CDP (one WebSocket,
│ Claude Code ├─────────────►│ aib daemon (~15–30 MB RSS)   │   flatten sessions)
└─────────────┘  (aib mcp    │  ├ session registry           ├──────────────► installed
┌─────────────┐   shim)      │  ├ snapshot/diff engine       │                Chrome/Edge
│ other agent ├─────────────►│  ├ motion engine (seeded)     │   SendInput    (dedicated
└─────────────┘  HTTP MCP    │  ├ determinism layer          ├──────────────► profile dir)
┌─────────────┐              │  ├ MCP server (rmcp)          │   (true-user
│ aib run *.yaml ────────────►  └ trace writers              │    mode)
└─────────────┘              └──────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.1 Process & session model

- **Long-lived daemon**, not per-invocation binaries. It owns the CDP WebSocket, event subscriptions, snapshot caches, and the true-user input lock. Per-invocation processes could not hold the continuous event streams that diff snapshots and event-driven waiting depend on. Idle auto-shutdown after N minutes.
- **Attach to the installed browser.** Registry lookup (`App Paths\chrome.exe` / `msedge.exe`) with well-known-path fallback; launch with `--remote-debugging-port` and a **dedicated `--user-data-dir`** under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aib\profiles\` — never the user's live profile.
- **One browser, many contexts.** Each session gets an isolated browser context (`Target.createBrowserContext`): own cookies/storage/cache/proxy, zero extra browser processes. This is Playwright's `newContext()` model without the per-worker browser duplication.
- **Session** = { browserContextId, pages, active page, persona, input mode, determinism config, seed, trace handle }. MCP connections bind to a session and can create/switch.
- **Crash handling:** WebSocket close / `Target.targetCrashed` → typed errors, sessions declared dead; agents re-create. No transparent state restoration in v1.

### 2.2 Resource profile (targets, to be validated by the Phase 1 benchmark)

| | Playwright + playwright-mcp | **aib** |
|---|---|---|
| Driver process | ~150–250 MB Node | ~15–30 MB Rust daemon |
| Per parallel session | new browser: +150–400 MB | new *context*: ~0 browser-side (+ per-page renderer, which Chrome spawns in both worlds) |
| Disk | ~1 GB browsers + node_modules | one ~15 MB binary, no downloads |
| Cold start | node + browser launch | daemon attach (browser often already running) |

Honest caveat: renderer memory is identical in both worlds. The savings are the driver process, per-worker browser duplication, and disk — not Chrome itself.

## 3. CDP Layer

**Hand-rolled minimal CDP client (~2 kLOC) over `tokio-tungstenite`** — not chromiumoxide (sparsely maintained; codegens the entire protocol, inflating compile times and churn surface). We need ~10 domains and ~60 commands.

- **Flatten-session mode** (`Target.attachToTarget { flatten: true }`): one WebSocket; a reader task demuxes by `sessionId`, then routes command responses via `oneshot` channels and events via bounded per-session `broadcast` channels (lag detection so slow consumers can't OOM the daemon).
- **Typed/raw hybrid:** hand-written `serde` structs for the commands and events we actually use (Input, Fetch, Accessibility get compile-time safety); `execute_raw(method, params)` escape hatch, optionally exposed as a config-gated MCP tool.
- **Domains (v1):** Browser, Target (incl. `setAutoAttach` for popups/OOPIFs — critical for OAuth), Page, Runtime (incl. isolated worlds), Input, DOM, Accessibility, Network (observe), Fetch (intercept), Emulation, Log, Security (opt-in cert-ignore for local dev).
- **Churn mitigation:** pin minimum Chrome at stable−2 with a startup check; `deny_unknown_fields` OFF everywhere; weekly CI against Chrome/Edge stable and beta.
- **`BrowserProtocol` trait** — coarse-grained operations (`create_context`, `navigate`, `snapshot_ax`, `dispatch_input`, `intercept`, …), not CDP-method-shaped, so a WebDriver BiDi implementation can slot in later without pretending BiDi has CDP's shape. CDP-only features (virtual time) may downcast; they are documented as Chromium-only.

Crates: `tokio`, `tokio-tungstenite`, `serde`/`serde_json`, `futures`, `thiserror`, `tracing`, `dashmap`, `rand_pcg`, `rmcp`, `windows`, `clap`, `serde_yaml`.

## 4. LLM-Facing Page Representation

The key ergonomics problem: what does the agent *see*?

**Primary source: an injected ARIA/DOM walker running in an isolated world** (`Page.createIsolatedWorld`), with the CDP Accessibility domain as validator/fallback. One `Runtime.callFunctionOn` round-trip returns roles, names, values, states, visibility, and stable refs in a single compact payload — something the raw CDP AX tree needs several round-trips to assemble.

Snapshot format — YAML-ish indented text with stable refs:

```yaml
- page: "Checkout — Acme" url: https://shop.example/checkout [e1]
  - main [e4]
    - heading "Payment details" (h2) [e5]
    - textbox "Card number" value="4242 4242 4242" invalid [e6]
    - combobox "Country" value="South Africa" [e7]
    - button "Pay R499" disabled [e8]
    - alert "Card number is incomplete" [e9]
```

Token-efficiency rules:

- Only interactive, named, or structural elements; pure wrappers collapsed.
- Text truncated (default 200 chars) with `…(+412 chars, browser_read ref=e12)`.
- Off-viewport subtrees elided by default; `snapshot(full=true)` or `snapshot(ref=eN)` on demand.
- Budget: median page ≤ 1.5k tokens; hard cap with pagination.

**Stable refs:** the walker keeps a `ref → Element` map inside the isolated world and reports `backendNodeId` mappings to the daemon. Refs are snapshot-epoch scoped; acting on a stale ref triggers cheap revalidation (still connected? same role/name?) and, on failure, a typed `StaleRef` error carrying a fresh diff — the agent self-corrects in one turn. Coordinates are resolved at action time (`DOM.getContentQuads`), never cached.

**Diff-based updates:** the injected script maintains a dirty-set via `MutationObserver` + `IntersectionObserver` + input/scroll listeners. Every action response embeds `changes:` — re-rendered dirty subtrees, removals, console errors since the last action, navigation events. Agents rarely call `snapshot` explicitly; the action loop is self-feeding. Navigation resets the epoch (`-- new page, refs reset --`).

**Screenshots on demand only** (`browser_screenshot`, viewport/full/element-crop, JPEG q≈70) — images are the token-budget killer, never automatic.

---

## 5. Actionability & Auto-Waiting (event-driven, no polling)

Replicates Playwright's checks — attached, visible, stable, enabled, receives events — but event-driven and with structured failure output:

1. Resolve ref → element; `DOM.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded`.
2. Injected `awaitActionable(el)` resolves when, across **two consecutive animation frames**, the element is connected, visible (non-zero rects, `display`/`visibility` ok), positionally stable (identical bounding box — Playwright's rAF-pair trick), and enabled. Built on MutationObserver + rAF, no polling loops.
3. **Hit test** from the daemon: `getContentQuads` → persona-weighted target point (not always dead center) → `elementFromPoint` chain check through open shadow roots. If occluded, report *what* occludes it.
4. **Post-action settling:** race { `frameNavigated` + `lifecycleEvent(networkAlmostIdle)`, DOM mutation quiet-window (~150 ms), timeout } and report which condition released the gate: `settled: network-idle after 640ms`.
5. Timeouts return a **structured report**: which check failed, last known element state, occluder ref if any. This is the single biggest agent-UX differentiator over raw Playwright errors.

`browser_wait_for` (text/ref/role+name appear/disappear, URL match) rides the same MutationObserver infrastructure.

---

## 6. Human-Motion Engine

A `motion` crate producing **backend-agnostic timelines**: `Vec<TimedInputEvent { at_ms, event }>`, computed entirely up-front from a seeded RNG, then replayed through either input backend.

- **Mouse paths:** minimum-jerk baseline with Bezier control-point perturbation; total duration from Fitts's law (`MT = a + b·log2(D/W + 1)`); probabilistic overshoot + damped correction for distant targets; low-amplitude noise jitter. The cursor position is session state — every path starts from the last position; the mouse never teleports.
- **Typing:** log-normal per-character delays classed by bigram (same-hand/alternating/repeat), burst-pause rhythm, optional typo+backspace injection (off by default, never in deterministic runs unless explicitly seeded on).
- **Scrolling:** wheel-event trains with momentum curve and settle jitter.
- **Personas** (TOML, user-extensible): `careful`, `average` (default), `fast`, `elderly` — parameterizing Fitts coefficients, jitter, dwell, cadence, error rate.
- **Reproducible realism:** per-action RNG = `Pcg64::seed_from(hash(session_seed, action_index, action_kind))` — same seed ⇒ byte-identical timelines, and inserting one action doesn't reshuffle subsequent paths. The seed is always reported in traces and tool output.
- **Speed knob orthogonal to persona:** `speed: 0` = instant Playwright-style dispatch (still passing actionability gates) for fast deterministic runs; `speed: 1.0` = real-time human.

### Input backends

| | **Synthetic-human (default)** | **True-user mode** |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanism | CDP `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`/`dispatchKeyEvent`, timeline-paced at ~60–125 Hz | Windows `SendInput` (via `windows` crate); trait allows macOS `CGEvent` / Linux `uinput` later |
| Headless | yes | no — headed, focused, unoccluded window |
| Parallel | yes | no — one OS cursor ⇒ daemon-wide lock, actions queue (`queued_behind: n` reported) |
| Event provenance | `isTrusted: true`, but debugger-dispatched | indistinguishable from a physical user at the OS level |
| Coordinate mapping | CSS viewport coords | **calibration probe**: dispatch an OS move to a predicted point, read back `event.screenX/clientX` in-page, solve the affine viewport→screen mapping — robust across browser chrome, zoom, and per-monitor DPI; recalibrate on window-bounds/zoom change |

True-user mode keeps CDP attached for *observation* (snapshots, settling, assertions) while input arrives from the OS. Focus is enforced (`SetForegroundWindow` + verification) with typed errors if the desktop is locked. CI use requires an interactive desktop session (autologon VM); it is positioned as a local/pre-release fidelity tool, not a scale tool.

---

## 7. Deterministic-Testing Layer

All shims are **per-context opt-in and OFF by default**, so third-party widgets (OAuth, payment sandboxes) see an untouched page in default mode.

- **Init scripts:** `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`, ordered bundle: [clock shim?, seeded `Math.random` shim?, user scripts].
- **Network:** `Fetch` domain exclusively for mutation (mock/block/delay/rewrite by URL pattern + method), `Network` events purely for observation/HAR — separating the two avoids a classic CDP bug farm. **Record/replay:** capture paused responses to a `.aibhar` (JSONL + bodies dir); replay matches on (method, normalized URL, optional body hash) with configurable fallback (error | passthrough).
- **Clock:** two modes — (a) `Emulation.setVirtualTimePolicy` (renderer virtual time; powerful, fully sealed tests) or (b) sinon-style JS shim of `Date`/timers/rAF via init script (surgical, safe on third-party pages).
- **Randomness:** `Math.random` ← seeded xorshift via init script; `crypto.getRandomValues` shim opt-in.
- **Capture:** console API calls, exceptions, browser log entries → ring buffer + trace.
- **Trace:** JSONL of `{ts, kind: action|snapshot|console|network|screenshot|assert, seed, persona, …}` with screenshots as files; `aib trace export` renders a static HTML viewer (later phase).
- **Assertions** evaluate against the snapshot model (role/name/value/state), not raw DOM — the same abstraction the agent reasons in.

---

## 8. MCP Surface

**One `browser` MCP server** (agents handle one coherent toolset better), built on the official **`rmcp`** Rust SDK. Transports: stdio (`aib mcp` shim auto-spawns the daemon) and streamable HTTP on loopback with a bearer token.

| Group | Tools |
|---|---|
| Session/nav | `browser_navigate {url, wait_until?}` · `browser_back/forward/reload` · `browser_tabs {action, index?}` · `browser_session {action, persona?, seed?, mode?: synthetic\|true_user}` |
| Observe | `browser_snapshot {full?, ref?, max_tokens?}` · `browser_read {ref}` · `browser_screenshot {ref?, full_page?}` · `browser_console` · `browser_network_log {filter?}` |
| Act (each returns `{ok, settled, changes, console_errors}`) | `browser_click {ref, button?, count?, modifiers?}` · `browser_type {ref, text, submit?, clear?}` · `browser_press {keys}` · `browser_select {ref, values[]}` · `browser_hover` · `browser_drag {from_ref, to_ref}` · `browser_scroll` · `browser_upload {ref, paths[]}` · `browser_dialog {action, text?}` |
| Wait/assert | `browser_wait_for {text?\|ref?\|url?\|role_name?, state, timeout_ms?}` · `browser_assert {ref?, assertion}` → pass/fail + actual |
| Determinism | `browser_mock_network {rules[]}` · `browser_record` / `browser_replay` · `browser_clock {install, now?}` / `browser_clock_advance {ms}` · `browser_init_script {source}` · `browser_trace {action, path?}` · `browser_evaluate {expression, ref?}` (config-gated) |

### Scripted tests vs agent exploration — the keystone workflow

Runner mode (`aib run tests/*.yaml`) executes YAML specs whose steps map **1:1 to the MCP tool names/args**. Because the mapping is exact, an agent's exploration trace exports directly as a runnable regression test:

> **explore with agent → freeze into deterministic test → run in CI forever.**

```yaml
name: checkout-happy-path
session: { persona: average, seed: 42, mode: synthetic }
mocks: [{ pattern: "*/api/quote", respond: { status: 200, body_file: quote.json } }]
steps:
  - navigate: { url: "http://localhost:3000/checkout" }
  - click:    { ref: { role: button, name: "Pay R499" } }   # role+name selectors in runner mode
  - wait_for: { text: "Order confirmed", timeout_ms: 10000 }
  - assert:   { assertion: { kind: url, matches: "/orders/*" } }
```

(Runner mode resolves role+name → element internally; ephemeral `eN` refs are an agent-mode concept.)

## 10. Strengths & Weaknesses of This Rewrite

### Strengths

1. **~10–20× smaller driver footprint**, zero browser downloads, single-binary deploy — an agent host can ship it trivially.
2. **Cheap parallelism** via browser contexts instead of browser processes.
3. **Input realism no existing tool offers** — a shared motion model feeding both CDP and true OS input, with personas.
4. **Reproducible realism**: seeded timelines make human-like runs replayable — a property neither "instant synthetic" nor "actual human" testing has.
5. **Agent-native observation**: token-budgeted snapshots, stable refs, diffs embedded in action responses — fewer tokens and fewer round-trips per agent step.
6. **Structured failure reports** agents can self-correct from in one turn.
7. **Explore→freeze workflow**: agent sessions become deterministic CI tests with no translation layer.
8. **Owned stack**: no dependency on Playwright's release cadence or design priorities.

### Weaknesses / Risks

1. **Reimplementing Playwright's actionability edge cases is the highest risk** — years of accumulated handling for pointer-event chains, cross-origin iframes (OOPIFs), `<label>` delegation, contenteditable, `<select multiple>`. Mitigation: port their checks conceptually, test against a corpus of gnarly real pages, ship a documented "known unsupported" list in v1.
2. **CDP churn under auto-updating browsers.** Using the installed Chrome/Edge means the browser updates beneath us. Mitigation: tolerant deserialization, pinned minimum version with startup check, weekly CI against stable + beta channels.
3. **Chromium-only v1.** The `BrowserProtocol` trait is the BiDi escape hatch, but some features (virtual time, isolated-world semantics) have no BiDi equivalent and will remain Chromium-only.
4. **Realism vs determinism is a real tension.** Seeded timelines reproduce *inputs* exactly, but page behavior under real timing varies run-to-run unless the virtual clock is installed — which sacrifices the timing realism you wanted. These are two modes; the proposal never claims both simultaneously.
5. **True-user mode is inherently serialized and desktop-bound** — one OS cursor, focus stealing by notifications, mixed-DPI edge cases, no headless. It is a fidelity tool, not a CI-scale tool.
6. **Some third-party widgets fingerprint CDP attachment itself** (e.g., `Runtime.enable` detection). Motion quality cannot guarantee such widgets behave; true-user mode with a quiet debugger helps but is not guaranteed. Documented honestly.
7. **Renderer memory is unchanged** — savings are driver/duplication/disk, not Chrome's rendering cost.
8. **Maintenance vs the cheap counterfactual.** playwright-mcp plus a motion plugin would deliver perhaps 70% of the value for 5% of the effort. This project is justified by the footprint, true-user mode, and owning the agent-ergonomics loop — and it dies of a thousand cuts without scope discipline. The phased plan and per-phase exit criteria are the discipline mechanism.
9. **Isolated-world invisibility is imperfect** — observers still run on the page's task queue; pathological pages can perturb timing-sensitive behavior.

## 12. Phased Roadmap

> **Revised 2026-07-11** after the external-research review (`.research/REVIEW.md`): the browser binary, not the driver, is the dominant cost, and motion-video capture is an explicit product requirement. Two browser-side phases (1.5a/1.5b) were inserted ahead of the human-motion engine, and the zero-download principle was deliberately relaxed for headless runs (auto-downloaded `chrome-headless-shell`, cached, with installed-Chrome fallback; headed runs still use the installed browser).

| Phase | Scope | Duration | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — CDP spike** ✅ | Hand-rolled client: attach to installed Chrome *and* Edge, create context, navigate, `Runtime.evaluate`, screenshot | 1–2 wks | `aib doctor` passes on both browsers; command round-trip p50 < 5 ms |
| **1 — Agent MVP** ✅ | Stdio MCP; injected walker + refs; navigate/snapshot/click/type/press/screenshot/wait_for; instant input through a bounded-poll actionability gate (daemon + diff snapshots deferred) | 3–4 wks | An agent completes a form flow using snapshots only; measured driver footprint vs Playwright (8 MB vs 120 MB RSS, 0.03 s vs 0.80 s CPU) |
| **1.5a — Browser efficiency** ✅ | Memory-reduction launch flags; auto-downloaded, cached `chrome-headless-shell` as the default headless binary with installed-Chrome fallback; process-tree memory measurement in doctor | 1 wk | Measured tree-RSS: shell ~170–350 MB vs installed Chrome/Edge headless ~450–1550 MB, on Windows and Linux; suite green on host + container |
| **1.5b — Screencast capture** ✅ | `Page.startScreencast` recording: JPEG frame sequence + manifest, animated GIF (pure Rust); `browser_record_start/stop` MCP tools. WebM/ffmpeg explicitly deferred — no verified environment has ffmpeg | 1 wk | 59-frame recording of an animated fixture (sliding box) produced a playable GIF, verified headed by the user watching it happen live and opening the resulting clip; integration + unit tests pass on Windows and in the Docker container |
| **2 — Human motion (synthetic)** ✅ | `motion` crate: seeded, persona-parameterized (`careful`/`average`/`fast`) Bezier mouse paths (Fitts's law, jitter, overshoot+correction) and per-character typing cadence; `browser_click`/`browser_type` gain opt-in `human_like`/`persona`/`seed` params, instant path unchanged by default. Scoped down from the original plan: diff-based `changes:` in action responses and drag-and-drop/hover-menu choreography deferred; **learning from a real human demonstration deferred to the next phase** | 1 wk | Same seed ⇒ identical timeline (unit-tested); headed demo watched live — cursor visibly curves before clicking, text appears character-by-character with pauses; unknown persona name rejected with a typed error, not a silent fallback; suite green on host + container |
| **2.5 — Human motion (trained)** ✅ | `browser_train_start`/`browser_train_stop`: record a real human's genuinely trusted input events (mouse+keyboard) during an explicit training window, fit a `Persona` from the observed variability (Fitts's-law constants, jitter, overshoot probability, typing cadence with outlier-pause filtering), replay through the same seeded synthesis synthetic personas use so consecutive replays are freshly varied, never byte-identical; `trained_profile` on a never-trained name fails with a typed error instead of silently falling back to a synthetic persona | 1 wk | Live-verified: real human capture (4 movements, 37 keystrokes) fit and saved a profile; two trained replays back to back reported different seeds and timings; an untrained profile name was rejected with a clear error; suite green on host + container |
| **3a — Determinism (network mocking)** ✅ | `browser_network_record_start`/`stop`: passively capture real request/response pairs to a named cassette via the `Network` domain; `browser_network_replay_start`/`stop`: intercept every request via the `Fetch` domain and fulfill from the cassette (matched by method+URL, served in recorded order per key), no live-backend dependency; an unmatched request during replay fails loudly instead of a silent passthrough | 1 wk | Integration-verified: recorded against a real local HTTP test server, replayed with that server shut down, page rendered identically; an unmatched request during replay surfaced as a fetch error, not a silent live-network hit; suite green on host + container |
| **3b-i — Determinism (init scripts + seeded randomness)** ✅ | `browser_add_init_script(source)`: registers JS via `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` that runs before any of a page's own scripts on every subsequent navigation (new CDP surface -- everything else injected so far runs after load via `Runtime.evaluate`); `browser_seed_randomness(seed)` is a convenience built on the same mechanism, overriding `Math.random` with a deterministic PRNG (mulberry32) | 1 wk | Integration-verified: an init script's value was visible to a fixture page's own first-run inline script (before-page-scripts ordering, not just before-agent-action); the same seed reproduced an identical `Math.random()` sequence across separate navigations while different seeds diverged; suite green on host + container |
| **3b-ii — Determinism (virtual clock)** ✅ | `browser_set_clock(time_ms)`: installs a virtual clock frozen at a given epoch time via the same init-script mechanism, overriding `Date`/`performance.now`/`setTimeout`/`setInterval`/`requestAnimationFrame`; `browser_advance_clock(ms)` moves it forward and synchronously fires every due callback in chronological order, including callbacks newly scheduled within the same advance. "Both clock modes" turned out to be one mechanism (frozen-unless-advanced), not two | 1 wk | Integration-verified: `Date.now()` reflected the installed time and stayed fixed without an advance; a 5s-delayed callback stayed pending until advanced past its delay; a 0ms-follow-up chain all fired within one advance call; suite green on host + container |
| **3b-iii — Tooling (console capture)** ✅ | `browser_console_start(name)`/`browser_console_stop()`: capture the page's `console.*` output and uncaught exceptions to a named JSONL trace, in chronological order. Needed no new CDP domain enable -- `Runtime` was already enabled on every page from Phase 1's walker/resolve injection | 2 days | Integration-verified: a fixture logging at multiple console levels and throwing an uncaught exception produced a JSONL trace with matching entries in the same chronological order; suite green on host + container |
| **3b-iv — Tooling (unified action trace)** ✅ | `Session`'s own action methods (navigate/click/type/press) append a one-line summary into the active console-capture trace, interleaved chronologically with console/exception entries -- one JSONL stream showing both what the agent did and what the page said in response. Zero overhead when no trace is active | 2 days | Integration-verified: a navigate + type + click sequence produced action entries in the correct chronological order; suite green on host + container |
| **3b-v — Tooling (assertions)** ✅ | `browser_assert(text, present?)`: immediate (no polling, unlike `browser_wait_for`) pass/fail text-presence check, failing as a genuine MCP tool-level error result (`CallToolResult::error`) rather than a protocol error; logged into the active trace when one is active | 2 days | Integration-verified: a passing check succeeds, a failing one returns a clear tool-level error identifying the expected text, and both outcomes are correctly logged into an active trace; suite green on host + container |
| **3b-vi — Tooling (YAML runner)** ✅ | `browser_run_yaml(source)`: executes a declarative YAML script (`navigate`/`click`/`type`/`press`/`wait_for`/`assert` steps, single-key-map format matching GitHub Actions/Ansible conventions) fail-fast; `browser_export_yaml(name)`: converts an already-captured action trace back into a runnable script of that same format -- "record once, get a checked-in test." **Phase 3 (Determinism) complete** | 3 days | Integration-verified: a hand-written script ran end to end; a deliberately-failing script stopped at the right step without running later ones; a real captured trace exported to YAML and replaying it reproduced the same end state; suite green on host + container |
| **4 — True-user mode** ✅ | Windows `SendInput` backend (`crates/cdp/src/os_input.rs`): real OS-level mouse/keyboard dispatch as a `true_input` opt-in on `browser_click`/`browser_type`, reusing the existing `mouse_path`/`typing_timeline` synthesis unchanged -- only the delivery mechanism (CDP vs. `SendInput`) changes. Headed sessions only, Windows only for v1 (typed error elsewhere). Coordinate translation reads the page's own `window.screenX`/`devicePixelRatio` rather than assuming a fixed DPI/zoom, so it isn't hardcoded to 100% scale -- but only today's actual machine configuration was exercised, not the full stated matrix; multi-monitor and a serialization queue for concurrent sessions remain deferred | 1 wk | Live-verified end to end: real cursor movement + real click focused a form field, real keystrokes typed into it, form submitted -- confirmed via a mid-test screenshot and a passing integration test. Two real bugs found only by live testing, both fixed: (1) a headed session owns *two* OS windows (initial launch + isolated `BrowserContext`), disambiguated via a new `Browser.getWindowForTarget` CDP command rather than erroring on ambiguity; (2) `SetForegroundWindow` silently fails from a background process (Windows' foreground-lock restriction) -- fixed via the standard `AttachThreadInput` workaround. A DPI-awareness gap (`SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext`) was also needed on this machine's 125%-scaled display. Suite green on host (Docker not applicable -- `SendInput` needs a real visible desktop session no headless container has) |
| **5a — Hardening (popup auto-attach)** ✅ | `Session` moves from a single hard-coded page to a page registry: a new top-level target (popup/new tab) opened as a side effect of interacting with the current page attaches automatically via browser-wide, observe-only `Target.setDiscoverTargets` + client-driven explicit attach; `browser_list_pages()`/`browser_switch_page(page_id)` let an agent explicitly discover and drive it, no auto-switching; the active page falls back to the original one if the active page closes itself. Cross-origin OOPIF (iframe) attach explicitly deferred -- top-level popups/new tabs only | 3 days | Live-verified: a fixture opens a real popup via `window.open()`, it's listed but not active, switching to it lets actions target its own content, and closing it via its own `window.close()` falls back to the opener. Three real bugs found only by live testing, all fixed: (1) `Target.setAutoAttach` (the originally planned mechanism) conflicts with this project's own explicit-attach flow for the primary page and hangs -- replaced with observe-only discovery; (2) Chrome can transiently create and destroy an extra, unrelated target around context/page setup -- `list_pages` made self-healing; (3) a closing page's destroy event isn't reliably delivered before it becomes unqueryable -- active-page fallback unified across both the event-driven and self-heal paths. Suite green on host and in the Docker container (repeated runs to rule out this project's known resource-contention flake pattern) |
| **5b — Hardening (streamable-HTTP MCP transport)** ✅ | The second of two MCP transports the original architecture always intended -- `aib mcp --http` serves the identical tool surface stdio does over a loopback-only (`127.0.0.1`, no bind-address flag), bearer-token-authenticated `axum`/`rmcp` HTTP listener; each session gets its own independent browser via a uniquely-suffixed profile directory, never a shared/pooled one. Pure Rust HTTP/MCP plumbing, no CDP protocol surface | 2 days | Verified via the automated suite (401 on missing/wrong token, a correctly authenticated session completes the MCP handshake and lists the real tool set, two concurrent sessions each navigate a real browser without a profile-directory collision) and manually against the compiled binary with `curl`. Suite green on host and in the Docker container |
| **5c — Hardening (same-origin iframes)** ✅ | The walker had zero iframe awareness -- not even for same-origin content, confirmed by reading the source before scoping this. Full cross-origin OOPIF support needs real CDP target-attach + frame-correlation work (`Page.frameAttached` parentId plumbing not in the protocol layer); the same-origin case needs none of that, since `contentDocument` is directly reachable from the parent's own `Runtime.evaluate` context. `assets/walker.js` recurses into same-origin iframe content under an `iframe` role node; `assets/resolve.js` accumulates ancestor-iframe coordinate offsets so clicks land correctly; a cross-origin iframe renders as an explicit "not inspectable" leaf instead of vanishing. Zero CDP protocol changes, zero Rust struct changes (`WalkerNode::role` is a plain `String`) | 1 day | Live-verified: a fixture with a same-origin (`srcdoc`) and cross-origin (`data:` URL) iframe shows the same-origin button with a usable ref in the snapshot; clicking it via that ref actually fires the iframe's own click handler, proving the coordinate accumulation math works, not just that the CDP call didn't error; the cross-origin frame renders as the explicit boundary text. Suite green on host and in the Docker container |
| **5d — Hardening (shadow-DOM-aware walker)** ✅ | Directly motivated by PROPOSAL.md's own stated top risk (reimplementing Playwright's actionability edge cases against real gnarly pages). The walker had zero shadow-DOM awareness -- any web component with an attached shadow root walked as an empty leaf. `assets/walker.js` walks `shadowRoot.children` instead of light-DOM `children` for open shadow hosts, and `slot.assignedElements()` for `<slot>` elements so projected light-DOM content shows up correctly; no wrapper node, unlike iframes, since an open shadow boundary has no functional consequence once walked. Closed shadow roots aren't surfaced -- `shadowRoot` reports `null` identically for "none" and "closed," genuinely undetectable from script, not a scoping choice. `assets/resolve.js` needed **zero** changes -- shadow DOM affects tree structure only, confirmed by live testing rather than assumed | 4 hours | Live-verified on the first attempt: a custom-element fixture with a directly-rendered shadow button and a slotted (projected) heading shows both in the snapshot with usable refs; clicking the shadow-nested button's ref fires its own handler, confirming `resolve.js` genuinely needed no changes. Suite green on host and in the Docker container |
| **5 — Hardening (remaining)** | Cross-origin OOPIF (iframe) auto-attach, weekly Chrome-beta CI, HTML trace viewer, **BiDi spike** to validate the protocol trait | ongoing | — |
